## Description
JSON Validator is used to check your agency’s data.json against required federal metadata schema. There are three ways you can validate data.json, either by validating a public URL, uploading a json file, or pasting the raw JSON into the form.

## How the US Government uses {{page.title}}
Makes it easier to see if you’re using the right JSON format. This is required by __REGULATION__ and __OMB rule__.

#### Case studies 
(only generate this section and links to case studies if this has the case studies tag)
