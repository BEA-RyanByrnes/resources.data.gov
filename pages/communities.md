## Open Data Community of Practice

## Who we are

There is an established community of open data leads, dataset owners, and others interested in federal open data that meets on a monthly basis. The Office of Management and Budget (Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer) and the Data.gov team at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) co-host a monthly meeting of the community on the first Tuesday of every month, at 11 a.m. Eastern. The meetings are held at GSA and can be attended virtually. The meetings are an opportunity for OMB and GSA to update the community on the Federal Data Strategy, OPEN Government Data Act implementation, to provide presentations on open data, and to share best practices. 

## Join

The community communicates through an open data listserv managed by GSA, with over 900 participants. The listserv is used to send meeting notices for the monthly open data meetings and to share information with the community. 


Anyone with a .gov or .mil email address can join the listserv. To join, send an email to listserv@listserv.gsa.gov with no subject and body content containing “subscribe open-data”.
